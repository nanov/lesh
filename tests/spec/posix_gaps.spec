# Constructs the new front end does not implement yet, one ticket per group.
#
# NOTE ON REFERENCE SHELLS. Two cases here legitimately differ under zsh, and
# lesh matching dash is CORRECT (ADR-0001: dash is authoritative for the POSIX
# floor, zsh only for the curated layer, dash wins on conflict):
#
#   - zsh does not glob the result of an unquoted expansion without `globsubst`
#   - zsh errors on a pattern that matches nothing rather than passing it through
#
# Do not "fix" lesh toward zsh here. ctest gates on dash for exactly this reason.
#
# These exist so the scoreboard keeps measuring. A corpus everything passes has
# stopped being a compass, and the markers name which ticket closes each gap.
